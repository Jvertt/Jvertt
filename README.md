## Hobbies

- Guitar: I have been playing guitar almost everyday for almost 10 years! I love almost every genre but right now reggea or indie is my favorite!
- Surfing: After living in Hawaii for a while I decided to take surfing very serious and even became a surf instructor! My biggest surf accomplishment is paddling out to Honolua Bay and catching a huge wave!
- Pickle Ball: This one is a recent skill I have acquired, but it has been taking a ton of my time lately, I hope to compete in my first tournament soon!
- Working Out: I love working out, it is not only great for physical health, but absolutely amazing for maintaining a strong mentality!
